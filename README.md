**Accountant Dashboard** â€” a fullstack web application designed to automate the daily work of school accountants. Instead of manually calculating food usage and entering student counts every day, the system helps users track product availability and automatically calculate consumption. In the future, features such as weekly menu management and Excel export for reporting are planned to be added.
